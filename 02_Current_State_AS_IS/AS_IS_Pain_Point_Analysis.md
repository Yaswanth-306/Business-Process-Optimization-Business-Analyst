# AS-IS Process Pain Points Analysis - Union Bank Loan Operations

## Overview
This document outlines the specific inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and risks identified during the analysis of the current (AS-IS) loan application and risk review process at Union Bank. These pain points serve as the primary justification for the proposed process optimization.

---

## 1. Operational Inefficiencies
* **Manual Data Entry:** Relationship Managers (RM) must manually input customer and loan data into the Loan Application Registry (LAR). This repetitive task increases the risk of data entry errors and significantly raises the Turnaround Time (TAT).
* **Spreadsheet-Based Analysis:** Credit analysts rely on Excel spreadsheets for calculating risk metrics and ratios. This creates "data silos" where information is not easily shared or audited across the organization.
* **Disjointed Intake Channels:** Applications are received via branch visits or email, leading to an unstandardized intake process that is difficult to track from day one.

## 2. Communication & Transparency Gaps
* **Email-Driven Approvals:** Decisions and escalations are handled through email threads. This lacks a formal audit trail and makes it difficult to retrieve historical decision-making data.
* **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Stakeholders, particularly Relationship Managers and Business Leadership, have no centralized dashboard to view the live status of an application as it moves between departments.
* **Manual Stakeholder Follow-ups:** Because the system doesn't provide automatic status updates, RMs must spend time manually checking with Credit or Compliance teams to update customers.

## 3. Risk & Compliance Vulnerabilities
* **High Rate of Rework:** Incomplete documentation often reaches the review stage before being caught, forcing the process to restart and causing frustration for both the customer and the RM.
* **Manual Compliance Escalations:** Compliance issues are identified and escalated through manual checks rather than automated system flags, increasing the likelihood of oversight or regulatory breaches.
* **Inconsistent Data Handoffs:** With five different teams involved (RM, Credit, Risk, Compliance, Ops), the manual transfer of files and data increases the risk of version control issues.

## Next Steps
These pain points will be addressed in the **03_Future_State_TO_BE** documentation by introducing automated data flows, centralized risk tools, and system-integrated approval workflows.
