# Business Process Optimization – Business Analyst

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end business process analysis and optimization based on real-world experience supporting Union Bank loan operations. The objective is to analyze the current loan application and risk review process, identify inefficiencies, and propose optimized future-state solutions.

## Business Problem
The existing loan processing workflow relies heavily on manual data entry, spreadsheet-based financial analysis, and email-driven approvals. These factors increase turnaround time (TAT), operational risk, and reduce visibility into application status.

## Project Scope
- Analyze the **AS-IS** (current-state) loan application and underwriting process
- Identify operational pain points and risk areas
- Design a **TO-BE** (future-state) optimized process
- Define business requirements and KPIs to measure improvement

## My Role (Business Analyst)
- Documented current-state processes (AS-IS)
- Identified process gaps, inefficiencies, and risks
- Created process flow diagrams and supporting documentation
- Proposed future-state process improvements aligned with business goals

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Process Mapping (AS-IS / TO-BE)
- Stakeholder Analysis
- Requirements Documentation
- KPI Definition
- Microsoft Excel
- Draw.io
- GitHub (documentation & version control)
