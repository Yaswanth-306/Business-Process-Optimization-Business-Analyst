# Business Process Optimization: Loan Application & Risk Review

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end business process analysis and optimization based on real-world experience supporting **Union Bank** loan operations. The objective was to analyze the manual, high-risk "AS-IS" loan processing workflow and design a streamlined, automated "TO-BE" state to improve efficiency and compliance.

## 📉 The Business Problem
The legacy loan processing workflow relied heavily on:
* **Manual Data Entry:** Relationship Managers manually inputting data into the Loan Application Registry (LAR).
* **Siloed Analysis:** Spreadsheet-based risk and credit calculations.
* **Lack of Transparency:** Email-driven approvals and manual status tracking, leading to high Turnaround Time (TAT) and operational risk.

## 🚀 The Solution (TO-BE State)
The optimized process introduces a centralized **Loan Origination System (LOS)** and a **Digital Customer Portal** to transition from a linear workflow to parallel, system-driven processing.

**Key Improvements:**
* **Automated Intake:** OCR data extraction and real-time document validation.
* **Parallel Processing:** Simultaneous Credit and Compliance reviews to slash TAT.
* **Digital Closing:** Integrated E-Signatures and automated disbursement to the Core Banking System (CBS).

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
* **Process Mapping:** Draw.io (BPMN 2.0 standards)
* **Requirements:** Functional (FR) & Non-Functional (NFR) Documentation
* **Analysis:** Gap Analysis, Stakeholder Analysis, User Stories
* **Documentation:** Markdown & GitHub Version Control
