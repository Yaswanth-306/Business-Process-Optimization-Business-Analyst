# Project Charter – Business Process Optimization

## Project Name
Loan Application & Risk Review Process Optimization – Union Bank

## Business Context
Union Bank’s loan application process involves multiple handoffs across relationship management, credit, risk, compliance, and operations teams. The process relies on manual data entry, spreadsheets, and email-based communication, resulting in inefficiencies, delays, and increased operational risk.
